===================

This is a web-based application for collecting notes.  I have used Evernote and Google Keep, but neither is quite right for me.  From a feature perspective, Evernote is perfect!  However, Evernote does not allow you to truly remove data from a closed account, and I don't like that.  Google Keep will complete remove your data, but it is an ugly interface and EXTREMELY basic.

I have been wanting to learn functional programming for a while.  I have a difficult time learning a programming language without something concrete to work on.  It seemed like a natural fit to create a note-taking application; it gives me a project to use to learn Javascript (a functional language) and provide a note-taking application that I will enjoy.  This project will be a work in progress as I learn Javascript, jquery, and any other JS frameworks I decide to use.

A side goal of this project is for me to learn the Google APIs.  My hope is to use Google Drive as the back-end storage for the notes.

Outstanding Work
----------------
- Need to make the UI pretty.
- Need to get jquery working for traversing the DOM.
- Need to create the storage mechanism against the Google Drive API.
